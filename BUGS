missing bootmain.c from printout
funny \ alignment in mmu.h

main.c:
	should use static int bcpu to avoid having live
	stack variable across the asm volatile that 
	changes %esp and %ebp.

init.c:
	should while(wait() >= 0);
	not just wait();

proc.c:
	comment at top of scheduler() should say
		via longjmp back to the scheduler
	not
		via longjmp back to the top of scheduler

	sched should panic if state == RUNNING.

	forkret comment should say "Return" not "return"
	
	as a consequence of the implementation of proc_kill,
	any loop calling sleep should check for p->killed
	and be able to break out with an error return.

	can swap procdump up after proc_kill
	and then have proc_exit and proc_wait on same sheet

	proc_exit should wake up proc[1] if any
	reparenting was done.

trap.c
	if spin locks are ever held without cli,
	trap should call yield() only if nlock == 0
