<h1>Lab: locks</h1>

<p>In this lab you will try to avoid lock contention for certain
workloads.

<h2>lock contention</h2>

<p>The program user/kalloctest stresses xv6's memory allocator: three
  processes grow and shrink there address space, which will results in
  many calls to <tt>kalloc</tt> and <tt>kfree</tt>,
  respectively.  <tt>kalloc</tt> and <tt>kfree</tt>
  obtain <tt>kmem.lock</tt>.  To see if there is lock contention for
  <tt>kmem.lock</tt> replace the call to <tt>acquire</tt>
  in <tt>kalloc</tt> with the following code:

  <pre>
    while(!tryacquire(&kmem.lock)) {
      printf("!");
    }
  </pre>

<p><tt>tryacquire</tt> tries to acquire <tt>kmem.lock</tt>: if the
  lock is taking it returns false (0); otherwise, it returns true (1)
  and with the lock acquired.  Your first job is to
  implement <tt>tryacquire</tt> in kernel/spinlock.c.

<p>A few hints:
  <ul>
    <li>look at <tt>acquire</tt>.
    <li>don't forget to restore interrupts when acquision fails
    <li>Add tryacquire's signature to defs.h.
  </ul>

<p>Run usertests to see if you didn't break anything.  Note that
  usertests never prints "!"; there is never contention
  for <tt>kmem.lock</tt>.  The caller is always able to immediately
  acquire the lock and never has to wait because some other process
  has the lock.

<p>Now run kalloctest.  You should see quite a number of "!" on the
  console.  kalloctest causes many processes to contend on
  the <tt>kmem.lock</tt>.  This lock contention is a bit artificial,
  because qemu is simulating 3 processors, but it is likely on real
  hardware, there would be contention too.
  
<h2>Removing lock contention</h2>

<p>The root cause of lock contention in kalloctest is that there is a
  single free list, protected by a single lock.  To remove lock
  contention, you will have to redesign the memory allocator to avoid
  a single lock and list.  The basic idea is to maintain a free list
  per CPU, each list with its own lock. Allocations and frees on each
  CPU can run in parallel, because each CPU will operate on a
  different list.
  
<p> The main challenge will be to deal with the case that one CPU runs
  out of memory, but another CPU has still free memory; in that case,
  the one CPU must "steal" part of the other CPU's free list.
  Stealing may introduce lock contention, but that may be acceptable
  because it may happen infrequently.

<p>Your job is to implement per-CPU freelists and stealing when one
  CPU is out of memory.  Run kalloctest() to see if your
  implementation has removed lock contention.

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>You can use the constant <tt>NCPU</tt> in kernel/param.h
    <li>Let <tt>freerange</tt> give all free memory to the CPU
      running <tt>freerange</tt>.
    <li>The function <tt>cpuid</tt> returns the current core, but note
    that you can use it when interrupts are turned off and so you will
    need to turn on/off interrupts in your solution.
  </ul>

<p>Run usertests to see if you don't break anything.

<h2>Lock-free bcache lookup</h2>


<p>Several processes reading different files repeatedly will
  bottleneck in the buffer cache, bcache, in bio.c.  Replace the
  acquire in <tt>bget</tt> with
  
  <pre>
    while(!tryacquire(&bcache.lock)) {
      printf("!");
    }
  </pre>

  and run test0 from bcachetest and you will see "!"s.

<p>Modify <tt>bget</tt> so that a lookup for a buffer that is in the
  bcache doesn't need to acquire <tt>bcache.lock</tt>.  This more
  tricky than the kalloc assignment, because bcache buffers are truly
  shared among processes. You must maintain the invariant that a
  buffer is only once in memory.

<p> There are several races that <tt>bcache.lock</tt> protects
against, including:
  <ul>
    <li>A <tt>brelse</tt> may set <tt>b->ref</tt> to 0,
      while concurrent <tt>bget</tt> is incrementing it.
    <li>Two <tt>bget</tt> may see <tt>b->ref = 0</tt> and one may re-use
    the buffer, while the other may replaces it with another block.
    <li>A concurrent <tt>brelse</tt> modifies the list
      that <tt>bget</tt> traverses.
  </ul>

<p>A challenge is testing whether you code is still correct.  One way
  to do is to artificially delay certain operations
  using <tt>sleepticks</tt>.

<p>Here are some hints:
  <ul>
    <li> Use an atomic increment instruction for incrementing and
      decrementing <tt>b->ref</tt> (see <tt>__sync_fetch_and_add() and
	related primitives</tt>)
    <li>Don't walk the <tt>bcache.head</tt> list to find a buffer
  </ul>
