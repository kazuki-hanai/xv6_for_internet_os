xv6 is a re-implementation of Unix Version 6 (v6), which was developed
by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. xv6 follows the structure and
style of v6, but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor
using ANSI C.

xv6 is inspired by the following work by Lions about Unix version 6:

- Lions' Commentary on UNIX' 6th Edition, John Lions, Peer to Peer
Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000). See
also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2006/v6.html, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

Code was used from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (bootother.S, mp.h, mp.c, ioapic.h, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)

The following people made contributions:
    Russ Cox (context switching, locking)
    Cliff Frey (MP)
    Xiao Yu (MP)

If you spot errors or have suggestions for improvement, please send
email to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
({kaashoek,rtm}@csail.mit.edu).  This version is the very first one,
so don't be surprised if there are errors or the code is unclear.
