xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

xv6 is inspired by John Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2006/v6.html, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (bootother.S, mp.h, mp.c, ioapic.h, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people made contributions:
    Russ Cox (context switching, locking)
    Cliff Frey (MP)
    Xiao Yu (MP)

so don't be surprised if there are errors or the code is unclear.
